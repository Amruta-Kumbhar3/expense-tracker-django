## 🌱 First Project Note

This is my **first Django project**, built to learn full-stack web development hands-on.  
Through this project, I explored:
- Building and structuring a Django web app  
- Connecting backend logic with a dynamic frontend  
- Working with databases, templates, and forms  
- Using Matplotlib for visual data representation  
- Deploying and managing code with Git and GitHub  

This marks the beginning of my journey into advanced software development and AI-integrated applications.
